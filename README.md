**Project Name :** BUILD A RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM USING JAVA AND LIBRARIES LIKE APACHE MAHOUT TO SUGGEST PRODUCTS OR CONTENT BASED ON USER PREFERENCES.
**Overview of the Problem**
The task is to build a recommendation system using Java and libraries like Apache Mahout. The system will analyze user preferences and suggest relevant products or content to users based on their behavior, preferences, or similarities with other users. Recommendation systems are widely used in e-commerce, streaming platforms, and social media to personalize user experiences.

**Key Components of the Problem:**
Data Collection:

The system requires data about users, products/content, and user interactions (e.g., ratings, purchases, clicks).

Recommendation Algorithms:

The system will use algorithms like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or matrix factorization to generate recommendations.

Apache Mahout:

Apache Mahout is a scalable machine learning library that provides tools for building recommendation systems.

User Preferences:

The system will analyze user preferences (e.g., past purchases, ratings) to predict what they might like.

Output:

The system will generate a list of recommended products or content for each user.
